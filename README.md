Quick script to warm back up to programming. Feel free to take + edit + criticize what you see here.


<strong>Usage:</strong>

Have csv file with  
	X values in column A  
	Y values in column B  
	Z values in column C  
Can't have column headers or footers, data must begin in row 1 and be delimited by commas  
Save file in same directory as this script (.exe file)  
Run .exe file  
	Enter file name when prompted (ex: datafile.csv)  
Output will be the filename preceded by OUT (ex: OUTdatafile.csv)  
Script will display (but not save) graph of data that include angle of line (starting from origin)  
Finished file will contain 2 rows of data in csv format (distance along line from origin, z-value)
